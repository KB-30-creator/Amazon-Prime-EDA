# Amazon-Prime-EDA

The entertainment industry generates a massive volume of content spanning diverse genres, formats, and platforms. Yet, identifying key trends in film and television production, assessing the impact of cast and crew on a title’s success, and pinpointing the drivers behind high ratings remains a complex task.

This project seeks to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to a combined dataset that includes metadata on movies and shows along with information about their cast and crew. The primary goals are to uncover insights such as:

1.The most frequent and influential actors, directors, and other industry roles

2.Trends in genres, runtimes, and production patterns over time

3.How factors like genre, runtime, and cast composition influence performance metrics such as IMDb and TMDb ratings

By analyzing these elements, the project aims to deliver a data-driven perspective on the entertainment landscape—providing valuable insights for stakeholders like production houses, casting professionals, and streaming platforms to support strategic decision-making.
